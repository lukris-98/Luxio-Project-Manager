# Insights



This guide shows you how to get insights for your app users&#039; Instagram media and professional accounts using the Instagram Platform.

In this guide we will be using **Instagram user** and **Instagram professional account** interchangeably. An  Instagram User object represents your app user&#039;s Instagram professional account.

**Success:** Instagram Insights are now available for Instagram API with Instagram Login. [Learn more.](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/insights)

## Before you start

You will need the following:

### Requirements

This guide assumes you have read the [Instagram Platform Overview](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/overview) and implemented the needed components for using this API, such as a Meta login flow and a webhooks server to receive notifications.

|  | Instagram API with Instagram Login | Instagram API with Facebook Login |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Tokens** | * Instagram User access token | * [Facebook User access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens#usertokens) |
| **Host URL** | `graph.instagram.com` | `graph.facebook.com` |
| **Login Type** | Business Login for Instagram | Facebook Login for Business |
| [**Permissions**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference#i) | * `instagram_business_basic`&lt;br&gt;* `instagram_business_manage_insights` | * `instagram_basic`&lt;br&gt;* `instagram_manage_insights`&lt;br&gt;* `pages_read_engagement`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the app user was granted a role on the [Page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/overview#pages) connected to your app user&#039;s Instagram professional account via the Business Manager, your app will also need:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* `ads_management`&lt;br&gt;* `ads_read` |

#### Access Level

* Advanced Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you don&#039;t own or manage
* Standard Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you own or manage and have added to your app in the App Dashboard

#### Endpoints

* [`GET /&lt;INSTAGRAM_MEDIA_ID&gt;/insights`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media/insights) — Gets metrics on a media object
* [`GET /&lt;INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;/insights`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/api-reference/instagram-user/insights) — Gets metrics on an Instagram Business Account or Instagram Creator account.

Refer to each endpoint&#039;s reference documentation for additional metrics, parameters, and permission requirements.

#### UTC

Timestamps in API responses use UTC with zero offset and are formatted using ISO-8601. For example: `2019-04-05T07:56:32+0000`

#### Webhook event subscriptions

- [`story_insights ` – **Only available for Instagram API with Facebook Login.**](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/webhooks)

### Limitations

#### Media insights

- Metrics such as `comments`, `likes`, and `views` return engagement on the target Instagram media only and don&#039;t include data from other surfaces. For example, `comments` returns the number of comments on a photo, but not comments on ads that contain that photo. Use `total_comments`, `total_likes`, and `total_views` on the Insights endpoint to get aggregated counts that include engagement from promoted/boosted/ad media. These total metrics are only available for Instagram API with Facebook Login.
- Live video Instagram Media can only be read while they are being broadcast.
- This API returns only data for media owned by Instagram professional accounts. It cannot be used to get data for media owned by personal Instagram accounts.  

#### Account insights

- Some metrics are not available on Instagram accounts with fewer than 100 followers.
- User Metrics data is stored for up to 90 days.
- You can only get insights for a single user at a time.
- You cannot get insights for Facebook Pages.
- If insights data you are requesting does not exist or is currently unavailable the API will return an empty data set instead of `0` for individual metrics.

## Examples
